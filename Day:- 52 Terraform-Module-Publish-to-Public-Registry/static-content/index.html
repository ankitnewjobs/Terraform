# Explanation: - 

# <!DOCTYPE html>

* This is called a DOCTYPE declaration.
* It tells the web browser that this document is written in HTML5, which is the latest and standard version of HTML.
* It’s not an HTML tag, but a special instruction that ensures the browser renders the page using standards mode, not quirks mode (which is used for old HTML versions).

# <html>

* This tag marks the beginning of the HTML document.
* Everything inside <html> ... </html> is part of your web page.
* It’s the root element, meaning every other tag lives inside it.

Example: <html lang="en">

# <body style="background-color:rgb(210, 189, 157);">

* The <body> tag defines the main content area of your webpage, which users actually see in their browser.
* Everything inside <body> gets displayed (text, images, links, etc.).

# Inside the <body> tag, you have an inline CSS style: style="background-color:rgb(210, 189, 157);"

##### Breakdown:

* style= → an attribute used to apply CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) directly to a single element.
* background-color: → a CSS property that changes the page’s background color.
* rgb(210, 189, 157) → defines the color using Red, Green, Blue values:

  * Red: 210
  * Green: 189
  * Blue: 157

# <h1>Welcome to Stack Simplify - APP-1</h1>

* <h1> stands for Heading 1, the most important (and largest) heading level in HTML.
* It’s typically used for titles or main headers.

# <p>Terraform Modules Demo</p>

* <p> stands for paragraph.
* It’s used to display blocks of text.
* The text “Terraform Modules Demo” is shown below the heading in normal-sized font.

# <p>Application Version: V1</p>

* Another paragraph, this time displaying the version number of the app.
* “Application Version: V1” indicates that this is the first release (version 1) of the demo application.

In a DevOps or Terraform context:

* This version info is often updated automatically (for example, through CI/CD pipelines).
* You might later deploy a V2 or V3 version, and this small HTML change helps verify that the new version was successfully deployed.

Example: <p>Application Version: V2</p>

If you saw “V2” in the browser after deployment, you’d know the update worked.

# </body>

* This closes the <body> section.
* Everything visible on your webpage must go inside the <body> tag — anything outside won’t be rendered by the browser.

### </html>

* This closes the entire HTML document.
* It tells the browser that the file has ended.

|   Element     |        What You See                    |            Description                        |
|-------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |

|  <h1>         |  Welcome to Stack Simplify - APP-1     |  Big bold heading                             |
|  First <p>    |  Terraform Modules Demo                |  Paragraph text under heading                 |
|  Second <p>   |  Application Version: V1               |  Displays version info                        |


# Why This Page Exists (Terraform Context)

In a Terraform demo, small static HTML pages like this are often used to:

* Verify that deployment works correctly.

  * For example, when Terraform deploys an Azure App Service or AWS S3 static website, you can open the URL and check that this page appears.
  * Differentiate multiple apps/modules. e.g. APP-1, APP-2, etc.
  * Show version numbers to confirm rolling updates or blue-green deployments are happening as expected.

So, if you changed the version text and redeployed: <p>Application Version: V2</p> and saw “V2” live in the browser, you’d know Terraform   applied the new configuration correctly.
