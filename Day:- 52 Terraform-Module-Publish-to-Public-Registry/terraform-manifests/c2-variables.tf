# Input variable definitions
## Place holder file

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Explanation: - 

# The Comments (# and ##)

Both # and ## are comments in Terraform (HCL language).
They are not executable; they exist purely to document or describe code.

# Let’s break down what they’re communicating here:

# Input variable definitions

* This line tells readers (or collaborators) that this file is **meant to contain input variable definitions.
* In Terraform, input variables are used to parameterize configurations, making your code reusable and flexible.

Example of what would go inside later:

variable "location" 
{
  description = "The Azure region where resources will be deployed"
  type        = string
  default     = "East US"
}

So, the first comment is like a section header, saying: > “This file is where we’ll define input variables later.”

## Placeholder file

* This comment indicates that the file is currently empty but intentionally kept in the repository.
* The purpose is to reserve its place in the Terraform project structure.
* It acts as a template or marker, signaling that variables will be defined here in the future.

# Why Create a Placeholder File: Even though there’s no executable code here, such “placeholder” files are very common in Terraform projects, especially in professional or team setups.

Here’s why it’s useful:

|        Reason               |                                                     Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Maintain project structure  | Many Terraform modules follow a convention: have separate files like main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf, and providers.tf. Keeping variables.tf (even empty) keeps the structure consistent. |
| Helps teams collaborate     | Future contributors immediately see where to put variables without guessing or creating duplicate files.                                                                                    |
| Supports modular design     | When you modularize Terraform code, modules expect certain files (like variables.tf). Having a placeholder ensures smooth future integration.                                               |
| Prevents confusion in repos | When the repo is scaffolded (created with empty Terraform files), placeholders show intent; they make it clear that the project is still under construction but organized.                  |

# Typical Terraform File Structure (Context)

To understand where this placeholder fits, here’s a standard Terraform project layout:

/my-terraform-project
│
├── main.tf              # Core resource definitions
├── variables.tf         # Input variables (this is your placeholder)
├── outputs.tf           # Output values after deployment
├── provider.tf          # Provider configurations (like azurerm)
├── terraform.tfvars     # Variable values (optional)
└── README.md            # Documentation

So your current file (variables.tf) might currently contain only comments, but it has an important role in maintaining structure and guiding future development.

# What It Might Contain Later (Example)

When you’re ready to define variables, your placeholder file might evolve like this:

# Input variable definitions

variable "resource_group_name"
{
  description = "Name of the Azure Resource Group"
  type        = string
}

variable "location"
{
  description = "Azure region to deploy resources"
  type        = string
  default     = "East US"
}

# Summary Table

|        Element                |       Meaning                  |                     Purpose                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  # Input variable definitions |  Comment heading               |  Explains the intent of the file                                  |
|  ## Place holder file         |  Comment                       |  Indicates the file is intentionally empty                        |
|  Placeholder file             |  Empty file kept for structure |  Keeps Terraform project organized and ready for future variables |
