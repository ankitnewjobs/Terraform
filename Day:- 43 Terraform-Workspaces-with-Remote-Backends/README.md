title: Terraform Workspaces with Remote Backend
description: Learn Terraform Workspaces with Remote Backend
---

## Step-01: Introduction
- We are going to use Terraform Remote Backend (Azure Storage)
- We are going to create 3 workspaces (default, dev, staging, prod) in addition to default workspace
- We will understand how the Terraform TF State Files get created in Azure Storage Account as part of multiple workspaces concept.

## Step-02: c1-versions.tf
- Add Backend block in Terraform Settings block
```t
# Terraform State Storage to Azure Storage Container
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name   = "terraform-storage-rg"
    storage_account_name  = "terraformstate201"
    container_name        = "tfstatefiles"
    key                   = "cliworkspaces-terraform.tfstate"
  }   
```

## Step-03: Create Workspaces and Verify State files in Storage Account
```t
# Terraform Init
terraform init 
Observation:
1. Go to Azure Management Console -> terraform-storage-tg -> terraformstate201 -> tfstatefiles
2. Verify file with name "cliworkspaces-terraform.tfstate"
3. Verify file size (Approx 155B)

# List Workspaces
terraform workspace list

# Output Current Workspace using show
terraform workspace show

# Create Workspaces
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace new staging
terraform workspace new prod

# Verify the workspace file names in Storage Account
cliworkspaces-terraform.tfstate:dev
cliworkspaces-terraform.tfstate:staging
cliworkspaces-terraform.tfstate:prod

# Delete Workspaces
terraform workspace select default
terraform workspace delete dev
terraform workspace delete staging
terraform workspace delete prod

# Verify the workspace file names in Storage Account
Observation:
1. All the workspace specific state files should be deleted automatically when workspaces get deleted.
2. Only `cliworkspaces-terraform.tfstate` default worksapce file should be present because we will not be able to delete default workspace. 
```

## Step-04: Clean-Up Local folder
```t
# Clean-Up local folder
rm -rf .terraform*
```

# Explanation: - 

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the code and steps you’ve shared. This workflow demonstrates how to **configure and manage Terraform Remote Backends using Azure Storage**, especially when using **multiple workspaces**.

---

## 🧩 **Step-01: Introduction**

* **Goal**: Manage Terraform state files in **Azure Storage** and use **multiple workspaces** (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`) to isolate environments.
* **Why?**:

  * Remote backend ensures the **Terraform state is stored centrally** and securely.
  * Using workspaces allows for **environment separation** without needing multiple folders.

---

## ⚙️ **Step-02: c1-versions.tf**

This step configures **Terraform backend** with Azure.

### 📄 Backend Configuration Block:

```hcl
backend "azurerm" {
  resource_group_name   = "terraform-storage-rg"
  storage_account_name  = "terraformstate201"
  container_name        = "tfstatefiles"
  key                   = "cliworkspaces-terraform.tfstate"
}
```

### 🔍 Explanation:

| Field                  | Purpose                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `azurerm`              | Specifies the backend provider (Azure)     |
| `resource_group_name`  | Resource Group containing the storage      |
| `storage_account_name` | Azure Storage Account where state is saved |
| `container_name`       | Blob container to hold the state files     |
| `key`                  | The name prefix of the state file          |

* **Terraform will automatically suffix this key** with the current workspace name (e.g., `cliworkspaces-terraform.tfstate:dev`).
* The default workspace doesn't get a suffix—it uses the key as is.

---

## 🛠️ **Step-03: Create Workspaces and Verify**

### 📌 Terraform Initialization

```sh
terraform init
```

* Initializes the backend and connects to the Azure storage.
* Creates `.terraform` directory locally and uploads the state file to the blob storage.

### 🔍 Azure Portal Observation:

* Navigate to your storage account:

  * `terraform-storage-rg` > `terraformstate201` > `tfstatefiles`
* You will find the state file named:

  * `cliworkspaces-terraform.tfstate` (for `default` workspace)

---

### 🔁 Workspace Commands

```sh
terraform workspace list
terraform workspace show
```

* Lists existing workspaces.
* Shows the currently selected workspace.

### ➕ Create New Workspaces

```sh
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace new staging
terraform workspace new prod
```

* Each command:

  * Creates a new workspace
  * Triggers Terraform to store a separate state file:

    * `cliworkspaces-terraform.tfstate:dev`
    * `cliworkspaces-terraform.tfstate:staging`
    * `cliworkspaces-terraform.tfstate:prod`

This allows you to use the **same codebase** but deploy **separate environments** (isolated infrastructure per workspace).

---

### ❌ Delete Workspaces

```sh
terraform workspace select default
terraform workspace delete dev
terraform workspace delete staging
terraform workspace delete prod
```

* Switch back to the `default` workspace (since you can't delete the current one).
* Delete the custom workspaces.
* Terraform deletes their corresponding state files from Azure Blob storage.

> ✅ **Default workspace** and its state file (`cliworkspaces-terraform.tfstate`) will remain.

---

## 🧹 **Step-04: Clean-Up Local Folder**

```sh
rm -rf .terraform*
```

* Deletes local `.terraform` directories and plugin cache.
* Useful when:

  * Re-initializing
  * Moving to a fresh setup
  * Ensuring clean state during CI/CD runs

## ✅ Summary

| Feature                               | Benefit                                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Remote Backend                        | Centralized and safe state storage                             |
| Azure Blob Storage                    | Durable and scalable                                           |
| Workspaces                            | Logical separation for environments (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`) |
| Unique `.tfstate` files per workspace | Prevents cross-environment state corruption                    |

Would you like a diagram to visually show how the workspaces map to different `.tfstate` files in Azure storage?
