# Explanation: - 

#### <!DOCTYPE html>
- This declaration tells the browser that the document is written in HTML5.
- It ensures modern browsers interpret the document correctly (without quirks mode).

#### <html>
- This is the root element of the HTML document.
- Everything inside it belongs to the webpage structure.

#### <body style="background-color:rgb(210, 176, 157);">
- <body> is the main container that holds all of the visible content on the webpage.
- The style attribute applies inline CSS styling directly to the body.
- background-color: rgb(210, 176, 157); sets the background color of the entire page using RGB values:
  - Red = 210
  - Green = 176
  - Blue = 157
- The combination produces a soft beige/tan color as the page background.

#### <h1>Welcome to Stack Simplify - APP-1</h1>
- <h1> defines a top-level heading (largest and boldest by default).
- Text inside is "Welcome to Stack Simplify - APP-1".
- This will appear large at the top of the page, usually used for the main title or header.

#### <p>Terraform Modules Demo</p>
- <p> stands for paragraph and is used to display blocks of text on a webpage.
- Here, it displays "Terraform Modules Demo".
- By default, paragraphs add spacing above and below themselves.

#### <p>ERROR PAGE</p>
- Another paragraph element.
- Shows text "ERROR PAGE".
- This indicates that the page is probably being used as a custom error page in a web application, perhaps when something goes wrong.

#### </body> and </html>
- </body> closes the body section of the HTML document.
- </html> closes the overall HTML document.

### How This Page Looks
When loaded in a browser:
- The background will be light beige (RGB(210,176,157)).
- At the top, a large heading says: Welcome to Stack Simplify - APP-1.
- Below it, two lines of text appear: Terraform Modules Demo and ERROR PAGE.

### Purpose of the Page
- This page is a simple HTML error page used in a Terraform demo setup.
- Since it says "ERROR PAGE" and references "Terraform Modules Demo," it suggests that:
  - It's being deployed as a test web page.
  - It may serve as a placeholder or default error page for an application load balancer, server, or containerized app.
