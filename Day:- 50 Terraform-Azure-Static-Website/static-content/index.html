# Explanation: - 

#### <!DOCTYPE html>

- Declares the Document Type Definition (DTD).
- Tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document.
- If this declaration were missing or incorrect, the browser could render the page in quirks mode, leading to inconsistent rendering across browsers.

#### <html>
  
- The root element of the HTML document.
- Everything that makes up the webpage is written inside <html> ... </html> tags.
- Browsers know that anything in between belongs to one HTML page structure.

#### <body style="background-color:rgb(210, 189, 157);">
  
- <body> defines the main content area of the webpage — whatever you see displayed in the browser window.
- The style attribute applies inline CSS styling (meaning the CSS is directly inside the HTML rather than in a separate .css file).
- background-color:rgb(210, 189, 157) sets the entire page background color using the RGB color model:
  - Red = 210
  - Green = 189
  - Blue = 157
- This color combination produces a light beige/tan shade, making the background look soft and neutral.

#### <h1>Welcome to Stack Simplify - APP-1</h1>
  
- <h1> is a heading element, used for top-level main titles.
  
- By default:
  - It has the largest font size compared to other heading tags (h2, h3, etc.).
  - Browsers render it in bold.
- The content displayed: Welcome to Stack Simplify - APP-1.
- In practice, this is likely the title of an application or demo project.

#### <p>Terraform Modules Demo</p>
  
- <p> defines a paragraph of text.
- By default, paragraphs add white space before and after themselves, keeping text blocks nicely separated.
- The content “Terraform Modules Demo” is displayed as regular text.
- This line indicates the page is related to a Terraform demo (Infrastructure as Code concept).

#### <p>Application Version: V1</p>
  
- Another paragraph element.
- Displays Application Version: V1.
- This line likely serves as versioning information, useful in deployments where multiple app versions may exist.
- Including such text helps teams identify which version of the application is currently deployed by simply opening the browser.
