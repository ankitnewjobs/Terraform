# ðŸ”–Day 1 of learning Terraform :- Infrastructure as a Code - IaaC

Let's first understand what Infrastructure as a Code means.

So, Let's get started!

# ðŸ“Œ Infrastructure as a Code:

Infrastructure as a Code is a game-changing approach in IT infrastructure management, where the provisioning of infrastructure is accomplished through Automation (by Writing Code) instead of the manual process.

In simple terms, it means the user needs to define and manage infrastructure resources like databases, computing services, networking, and more.

By adopting this practice, organizations can transition from a manual approach to writing and configuring code. This allows them to take advantage of version control, a system that helps developers make changes in the code over time. Ultimately, this leads to higher reliability and scalability.

Now, let's talk about the powerful tool in the Infrastructure as a Code ecosystem - Terraform.

# ðŸ“Œ Introducing Terraform:

Terraform is one of the leading tools in the Infrastructure as a Code ecosystem, developed and maintained by HashiCorp.

It enables users to create, provision, and configure infrastructure resources across multiple cloud providers and on-premises environments using a simple and human-readable configuration language.

# ðŸ”– Challenges that Terraform Allows us to Solve:
- Create reusable Code: - Deploy Identical set of Infrastructure
-

- Support thousands of providers like AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, Oracle, etc.

# ðŸ”– Some of the Best Features of Terraform:

âœ… Terraform supports multiple cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, Azure, and many more, along with various third-party integrations.

âœ… It's user-friendly, making it easy to learn and use, and you don't have to worry about the deployment of resources.

âœ… Easy integration with configuration management tools like Ansible. Easily extensible with the help of plugins.

âœ… The best part, is it's free!!!ðŸ¥³

With Terraform, you can easily create, modify, and destroy your infrastructure environment.

2 Ways to create and manage infrastructure: 
A) Manual Creation 
B) Automation 

- Depending upon the task, tools for the automation will change.

# ðŸ“Œ Benefits: - 
A) Speed of Infrastructure management
B) Low risk of Human resources
C) Version Control 
D) Easy Collaboration with Teams

# ðŸ“Œ Choosing the Right Tools: -

# ðŸ“Œ How to Choose IAC Tool: 
1) Is your Infra going to vendor Specific in the long term - AWS, Azure
2) Planning to have Multi/Hybrid Cloud-based?
3) How will your IAC tool configure with Configuration management tools
4) Price and Support

# ðŸ“Œ Why do we need Infrastructure as a Code and Terraform?

âœ… Automation and Efficiency: IaaC and Terraform automate manual tasks, increasing efficiency and reducing errors.

âœ… Consistency & Version Control: Version-controlled code ensures consistent infrastructure deployment, reducing configuration drift.

âœ… Scalability & Flexibility: Easily scale resources up or down to handle changing demands and manage complex environments.

âœ… Disaster Recovery & Reproducibility: Recreate entire infrastructure from code to recover quickly from failures and ensure reproducibility.

âœ… Multi-Cloud Support: Terraform supports multiple cloud providers.

# ðŸ“Œ In conclusion, Infrastructure as a code powered by tools like Terraform, empowers organizations to build, modify, and share infrastructure with ease.
